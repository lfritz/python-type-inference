Python Type Inference
=====================

Approximate Type Inference for Python 3

This is a proof-of-concept implementation of a method for fast, approximate type inference for Python 3 which I developed for my M.Sc. thesis project at Utrecht University in 2011. It's written in Haskell and consists of two Cabal packages:

* `python-type-inference` is the implementation of the method
* `infer-python-types` is a small command-line program to run type inference.

Both packages are open-source under the terms of the three-clause BSD license. See file `LICENSE` in each directory.
